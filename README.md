## What this extension is

This is an **unofficial** extention created by Tobiah Zarlez, and is not affiliated in any way with Corona Labs. 

The goal of this extention is to add miscellaneous functionality to Visual Studio Code for Corona developers.

## What this extension isn't

This is not a comprehensive set of tools for Corona development, nor does it provide any debugging features.

### Can you add XZY feature?

Possibly! Let me know, I'd love to hear your suggestions on what tools you'd like to see added to this collection.

## How to install

You can install this extension directly from the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Tobiah.corona-tools).

Launch VS Code Quick Open (Ctrl+P) and copy/paste the following command:

> ext install corona-tools

## Feature list:
### Open Corona Documentation
Use the "Open Corona Documentation" command (`Cmd+'` on OSX or `Ctrl+'` on Windows and Linux) to open the Corona Documentation for the currently selected class.

### Search Corona Documentation
Added the pallet command "Search Corona Documentation" (Shortcut: `Cmd+Shift+'` on OSX or `Ctrl+Shift+'` on Windows and Linux) where you can quickly enter whatever you want to search for.
