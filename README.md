# Unity Tools for Visual Studio Code
## What this extension is

The goal of this extention is to add miscellaneous functionality to Visual Studio Code for Unity developers

## What this extension isn't

This is not a comprehensive set of tools for Unity development, nor does it provide any debugging features.

### Can you add XZY feature?

Possibly! Let me know, I'd love to hear your suggestions on what tools you'd like to see added to this collection.

## Feature list:
### Open Unity Documentation
Use the "Open Unity Documentation" command (`Cmd+'` on OSX or `Ctrl+'` on Windows and Linux) to open the Unity Documentation for the currently selected class.
